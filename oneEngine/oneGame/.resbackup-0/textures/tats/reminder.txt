50% gray is white on tattoo textures
100% white is fullbright on textures
67% gray is 33% brightness with +33% additive blending of tattoo to skin, limited to total 100% white. Basically, it blends glow in and out depending on surrounding lights.

marking naming convention

scars:		scar_*
markings:	clan_*
tattoos:	tatt_*
fluxxglows:	glow_*  (though these may be similar to "clan," the difference being they are from 50% to 100% color)

colors need to be limited to below 50% gray->only fluxxors may have glowing markings

note that the body recieves a different shader uniform for xscaling. Tattoos are scaled halfway horizontally when rendering to the body. the head does not do this
this is because the head does not overlap UVs like the body does. so, the head doesn't need a special sampling



body_flux_glowN and head_fluxx_glowN are system tattoos. They are tribals that all fluxxors must have.
0 "Wild Sun"
1 "Order"
2 "Soul Flow"
these system tattoos are not projected onto the model, but are drawn directly to the UV set. They're tailors especially for fluxxor uv's
