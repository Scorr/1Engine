 The Talforina Snowdrop Lily is a somewhat rare flower found only blooming in the most harsh of weather. While easy enough to cultivate, they tend to only grow naturally in frigid wastelands.
 Maybe in part because of where it grows, it is sometimes also called the 'Despair Lily.' Travellers who find themselves looking at a Talfornia Snowdrop will typically be facing a life-or-death situation.
 Since the name 'Despair Lily' has spread, it can be assumed that the travellers don't die in the tundra, but rather at the hands of bandits who stalk the edges of the tundra.
