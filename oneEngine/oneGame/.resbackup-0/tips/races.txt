CRACE_HUMAN
{
Humans are ingenious. How so? They're the race that made this game.

CRACE_ELF
{
The legends say that the elves, as a whole, were a very proud collection of races. So proud, in fact, that even when they really needed to just make babies, they didn't. Their proud nature ended up making them a group of collective anti-social individuals, and they slowly died out. Well, that's what these slightly less proud dark-skinned elves say.

CRACE_DWARF

CRACE_KITTEN
{
The tail. Dear gawd make it stop waving around

CRACE_FLUXXOR
{
After much contesting over their design, the fluxors finally decided to be humanoid. A little too humanoid, I'm going to admit, but nobody else is taking the damn time to draw some concept for some energy beings. Seriously, I have 17 credits. That's four tens! And that's horrible! But how is it that I'm still doing more work on this than everybody combined?!
Anyhow, the Fluxor (fluxors?) are a race of energy beings. Well, sort off. They have a skin, I guess, but I would presume they bleed energy. Oh, that's a neat passive for the fluxor skill tree. Stamina->mana is already decided as low-tier, but the health->mana link would be INSANE. Nigh invulnrable, until you get nuked down. Good stuff.
