*.mcc.VXG files		Custom 3D image format: MCC Variant aligned voxel graphic. All data values are 32 bit aligned. Data is Zlib compressed. Every sector is prefixed with 4 characters (32 bits) to identify itself. Windows users, note that for the editor, file extensions are case-sensitive. The format is extremely easy to parse, but a small library to load the data can be given on request. Run the engine with the command line argument "voxeleditor" for the demonstration of the format.

_floorplan_manifest	List of floorplans used for generating buildings. Plaintext file, same format as _culture_manifest
