## this is a special case material
## since eyes are these really cool things that control how freaky/inhuman/emotional a character is
##  (examples: demons with black eyes, cat eyes vs human eyes, anime eyes)
## don't be surprised at the super specific definitions here

## Eyes have a specific main entry.
main_eyes
{
	## The following MUST go first in the entry otherwise the material will not be configured properly.
	begin_eyepass

	## Define the eye background texture (fluxxors have a black background)
	base		textures\c\eye_base.png
	## Define the eye forground texture (different races have different irises)
	iris		textures\c\eye_iris.png
	## Define the eye pupil texture (for expansion and masking the focus color)
	pupil		textures\c\eye_kitty_pupil.png


	specular	true
	lo
}

## Fallback for eyes
main_fallback
{
	texture		textures\c\eye_fallback.png

	shader		default
}

## Deferred pass

	diffuse		eyes
